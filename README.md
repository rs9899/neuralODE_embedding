## Summary of the paper

* One of the key insight on the paper was giving a new continuous layer approach instead of Residual Network.
* The comparison what done with Residual networks like ResNet and how each layer just work as a small change to the original input.
* ODE Network changes this step wise approach to continuous domain.
